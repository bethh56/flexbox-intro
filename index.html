            <section>A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. In your world you have total and absolute power. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. We'll have a super time.</section>
            <section>It's cold, but it's beautiful. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.</section>
            <section>Learn when to stop. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.</section>
            <section>If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Very easy to work these to death. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. With practice comes confidence. Use your imagination, let it go.</section>
